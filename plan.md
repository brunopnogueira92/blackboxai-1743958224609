# Plan for Voting Application

## 1. User Registration and Authentication
- Ensure the `/register` and `/login` endpoints are functioning correctly.
- Validate user input and handle errors gracefully.

## 2. Voting Functionality
- Implement the following endpoints:
  - **List Polling Stations**: Already implemented in `/stations`.
  - **Submit Vote**: Ensure the `/submit` endpoint validates input and records votes correctly.
  - **Vote History**: Ensure the `/history` endpoint retrieves user-specific voting data.

## 3. Frontend Development
- Create a mobile-friendly web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Use a framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for responsive design.
- Implement forms for user registration, login, and vote submission.

## 4. Deployment
- Prepare the application for deployment on Render.
- Create a `Dockerfile` if not already present, ensuring all dependencies are included.
- Set up environment variables for production.

## 5. Testing
- Test all endpoints using Postman or similar tools.
- Ensure the frontend interacts correctly with the backend.

## 6. Documentation
- Document the API endpoints and usage instructions for users.
